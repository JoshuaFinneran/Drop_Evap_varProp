# Drop_Evap_varProp

This repository contains the code used to produce all the results in the paper "TBC"

The code provides the numerical solution for a single, spherical droplet immersed in a quiescent, isotropic gaseous medium that extends to an infinite distance with variable fluid properties in the gas phase.

All computer code is contained within the .zip file Evap_VariableProperties_Code.zip. Instructions on how to effectively use the code are provided within the .zip file, see READ_ME.txt.
